# Visual-Odometry---Self-Driving-cars
Visual odometry is used for estimating the trajectory of the robot. In this project we have been given a data set with frames of a driving sequence taken by a camera in a car. We are to estimate the 3D motion of the camera and provide a plot of the trajectory of the camera. We have been given the scripts to extract the intrinsic parameters using which the essential and Fundamental matrices can be calculated. Using this we compute the rotation and translation components thus estimating the 3D motion.
